Je pense que les phrases les plus importantes sont les suivantes :

> Many people who wrote 100-line programs in college imagine that they could write 1,000-line programs if they worked at it 10 times longer. Or even worse, they imagine they could write 10,000-line programs if they worked 100 times longer. It doesnâ€™t work that way.
