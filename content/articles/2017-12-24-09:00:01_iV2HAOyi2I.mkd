First released [in 2008](http://www.paulgraham.com/arc0.html), *arc* (or *anarki*, for the community-driven fork)
is a [lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html)-derivative
directly coming from [Paul Graham](ihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%20Graham%20(computer%20programmer)).

To me, it seems that lisp-derivatives future are best represented
by Arc and [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) (i do not understand exactly the relation between the two, but both communities are well-aware of the other, and seems to [share a common source core](https://github.com/arclanguage/anarki/issues/27) ; is racket based on arc/anarki ? One supplementary reason to learn it ! Racket makes eyes at me since i discovered it).

The first seems to me that it's mainly implemented, fed and builded
by and for a niche of lisp-enthousiasts with
[very philosophic ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/design.html)
of what should and what should not be in [a good language](http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html).

The second is much more general-scientific programmer oriented, with [a more practical approach](http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/home/matthias/manifesto/), and with dozens of features that range from funny to killing (make your own languageâ€¦ i have to code an ASP mapping !).
I am hyped by Racket, therefore not very objective.

You can give a shot to Arc [here](http://tryarc.org/).
