In short, [biolapse](http://biolapse.com/) is about making timelapses
of biology phenomena. It's all made by someone named Chris Field, that was
related to the now terminated [Chronos Project](http://thechronosproject.com/), that was about making hardware for timelapses.

You can found all the biolapse videos on [the vimeo account](https://vimeo.com/user3779442), like [flower 4k](https://vimeo.com/224012672).
