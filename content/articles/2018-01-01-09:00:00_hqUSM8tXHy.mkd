I discovered this via [the explanation of the visualization](https://codisec.com/binary-visualization-explained/).

Codisec itself is a group of [CTF](http://www.cipher-ctf.org/CaptureTheFlag.php)
players using their expertise for security.
See [their front](https://codisec.com/) and [github](https://github.com/codilime/veles).
