To put it simply: Waterfox is Firefox, without the features that are
considered dangerous for privacy/liberty.

It's therefore suited for power users that want to regain
their liberty about addons and plugins.

From the website: no pocket app by default, no encrypted extensions,
handling of non-certified extensions.
